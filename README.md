this repo contains the code made during a stream on my [twitch chnnel](https://twitch.tv/royalduck_dev) it is a snake game with power-ups made in python that can be compiled into an executable to be shared

# build

you can either run the python file directly or build the program to be an executable using the command:  
`cd build && python3 build.py`

# gameplay
